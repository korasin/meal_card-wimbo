Meal card wimbo is a project dedicated to solving 
the problem on food outrage in schools.
It gives an easy time to operators on knowing 
which student has taken a meal, one who is registered 
in the school website and the new students.
This profile is well presented by use of JavaScript 
and the structure of the web is presented by
html.
Bootstrap and CSS plays a key role in styling 
of the website and make it aesthetic.
